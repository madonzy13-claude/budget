# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-11 for v1.1 milestone)

**Core value:** A family can replace a complex personal-budget spreadsheet with a multi-user, multi-currency tool that tells them — through a single Tasks queue — exactly what to do this week to keep budget, reserve, and cushion healthy.
**Current focus:** Phase 05 — reserves-wallets-tabs

## Current Position

Phase: 05 — COMPLETE
Plan: 8 of 8
Status: Phase 05 complete
Last activity: 2026-05-17 -- Phase 05 marked complete

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**Carried-forward from v1.0 (still in force after restructure):**

- Postgres + tenant_id + RLS (not schema-per-tenant); app + worker roles have NO BYPASSRLS; FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY on all user-data tables
- Better Auth + organization plugin (used for SHARED budgets; app-facing label "shared budget")
- Drizzle (not Prisma) for first-class `pgPolicy()` RLS
- Crypto-shredding day 1 — PII columns separated from ledger
- dependency-cruiser CI rule — `domain/` cannot import `drizzle-orm`, Hono, AI SDK, or `adapters/`
- 80% domain coverage threshold in `bunfig.toml`
- TransactionRepo split surface: create() delegates to createInTx()
- FX freshness gate (60-min server-side threshold; 409 FxRateStale with freshRate payload)
- Web app avoids bundling pg/drizzle: getSupportedCurrencies() fetches /api/currencies endpoint

**v1.1 milestone decisions (from v1.1-SPEC.md):**

- Rename workspace→budget and account→wallet at every layer in one mega-migration
- Drop `transaction.kind` / `account_id` / `to_account_id` / `direction` — transactions are categorical-only
- wallet_type enum is display-only (SPENDINGS / CUSHION / RESERVE); no income/transfer ledger
- Reserves auto-compute via SQL view (materialized view as fallback in plan-phase)
- Cushion-mode is a budget-wide toggle with history tracked (SCD-2 mini-table or audit-log snapshot — decision deferred to Phase 1 plan)
- Tasks queue: 4 deterministic generators (RESERVE_TOPUP / CONFIRM_DRAFT / STALE_WALLET / MONTH_END_REVIEW)
- Recurring drafts surface only in Spendings grid as highlighted rows (standalone inbox UI removed)
- Share-link only invite flow (no email send required) via Better Auth orgs invite-token
- Dev DB nuked — no data preservation; acceptable because no prod deploy
- [Phase ?]: Phase 3-02: UserDisplayCurrencyReader local port avoids budgeting → identity coupling; FxProvider adapted to rateAsOf; tenant-leak gate 5→6 files
- [Phase ?]: BDP-03 backend shell ships as port + service + adapter + sub-router trio mirroring HOME-02
- [Phase ?]: Tenant-leak gate adds one file per new tenant-scoped endpoint; BDP-03 increments 6 -> 7 files
- [Phase ?]: Plan 03-04: Header z-index bumped from z-40 to z-50 so BudgetSwitcher PopoverContent z-[60] floats above and BDP sticky wrapper z-40 (Plan 03-06) renders below.
- [Phase ?]: Plan 03-04: Middleware OVERWRITES x-pathname (not set-if-absent) to discard any client-supplied value — T-03-04-06 mitigation.
- [Phase 3]: Plan 3-5: lucide v1.14 renames BarChart3 → ChartColumn; tests accept svg.lucide-chart-column OR svg.lucide-bar-chart-3 for stability across upgrades
- [Phase 3]: Plan 3-5: BudgetCard error path keeps Link wrapper so card always routes to /budgets/[id]/spendings — tenant guard enforces access at BDP
- [Phase 3]: Plan 3-5: Async-RSC + RTL test pattern — await Component({props}) then render(ui); mock @/lib/budget-fetch.server + next-intl/server.getTranslations
- [Phase ?]: Plan 03-06: i18n bdp.tab.\* nested {label, title, placeholder} shape locked upfront in Task 1 (BLOCKER #11 resolution)
- [Phase ?]: Plan 03-06: TaskBanner 60s polling test asserts DELTA across vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(60_000) rather than exact mount-time call count
- [Phase 3]: Plan 03-07: Better Auth cookie-copy via /auth/sign-up/email POST + context.addCookies() — preferred over UI form-fill because it survives sign-in form evolution
- [Phase 3]: Plan 03-07: Dynamic `import('pg')` in E2E task-seeding step keeps pg out of the web bundle
- [Phase 3]: Plan 03-07: DATABASE_URL_APP rewriter (@db: -> @localhost:) lets E2E steps run from host AND inside compose net
- [Phase 3]: Plan 03-07: Empty-user step inlines signup (rather than swapping fixtures) because playwright-bdd binds steps to a single test extender

### Pending Todos

- Phase 1 complete — begin Phase 2 planning (Domain & API Restructure)
- Decide reserves auto-compute as regular view vs materialized view in Phase 2 plan
- Probe Better Auth orgs invite-token revocation API in Phase 2 spike
- Investigate pre-existing make ci-gate coverage threshold failure (tenant-leak tests pull transitive imports; ~51% aggregate vs 80% threshold — security tests all pass 25/25)

### Plan 01-01 Decisions (recorded 2026-05-11, execution)

- Conditional DO block for workspace_share_dirty rename — fresh DB installs skip (post-migration.sql creates budget_share_dirty directly)
- wallet_type stored as text+CHECK in Drizzle schema, PG ENUM in migration SQL — easier future ALTER TYPE

### Plan 01-02 Decisions (recorded 2026-05-11, execution)

- Backward-compat shims: account.ts/account-repo.ts/workspace.ts/workspace-repo.ts kept with re-exports for Plan 01-03 migration period
- D-07 minimum compile-fix: TransactionRow.kind and TransactionRow.accountId TypeScript fields preserved; SQL INSERTs/SELECTs drop account_id/kind only — Phase 2 reshapes TS types
- Better Auth organizationId carve-out confirmed: schema.ts organizationId JS field maps to budget_id SQL column per Better Auth org plugin contract
- Backward-compat export aliases on all renamed Drizzle tables — avoids cascading compile failures before 01-02
- tasks table ownership DO block in migration handles postgres-superuser dev installs
- drizzle-kit TTY limitation requires hand-authored migration; journal entry registered manually

### Phase 1 Late Decisions (recorded 2026-05-11, post-research)

- D-10: Header `X-Workspace-ID` → `X-Budget-ID` renamed in lockstep with routes/tables
- D-11: Cushion column stays `cushion_amount` (already exists in schema); `_cents` suffix not applied
- D-12: `balance_adjustments` retained (WALT-03 manual edit path); FK cols renamed
- D-13: `categories.scope` dropped (redundant with budget-level visibility); cascades through ~8 files

### Plan 01-04 Decisions (recorded 2026-05-11, execution)

- workspace-fetch.ts/workspace-fetch.server.ts kept as backward-compat shims re-exporting from budget-fetch to avoid missed import paths
- D-13 scope cascade: filter chips UI, category form, E2E steps, i18n keys all cleaned up in single plan
- Migration 0012 made idempotent via DO $$ IF EXISTS $$ wrappers — Postgres lacks IF EXISTS on RENAME TABLE
- Function ownership fix needed for dev DB (postgres-owned functions from prior superuser post-migration.sql run); fresh DB (CI) creates correctly
- make ci-gate coverage threshold failure is pre-existing (tenant-leak transitive imports pull uncovered packages); 25/25 security tests pass

### Blockers/Concerns

- None blocking; roadmap is approved and dependency graph is clean
- Risk register in ROADMAP.md tracks 10 known risks across phases
